## Missionary Recommendations
The process of recommending a missionary is managed in the [Missionary Online Recommendation System (MORS)](https://missionaryrecommendations.churchofjesuschrist.org). 

When an individual expresses their interest in serving a mission, the bishop initiates the process using MORS and the process starts from there.

The bishop will receive the medical and dental evaluation forms. He should review the forms before passing them to the stake clerk for entry into MORS.

**Bishops,** please review the following before passing the recommendation on to the stake level:

* Make sure that, in their photo, the candidate is wearing missionary attire as described in MORS.
* If a psychological evaluation is indicated for any reason, please arrange that with **Church Family Services** and review the results before forwarding the recommendation to the stake level.
* If there are special concerns or considerations, please discuss those with the stake president.
