## General Notes

When meeting with an individual to give them a call, it's important to discuss with them the responsibilities of the calling so that they know what they are agreeing to. Before the interview, it may be valuable to read the description of the calling and responsibilities in the [General Handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng).

Per the [General Handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng), when setting apart a person to a role that requires a high priest (such as bishop, bishopric councilor, or high councilor), only high priests should be in the circle. Likewise, when a man is ordained a high priest, only high priests may stand in the circle.

## Missionary Recommendations
The process of recommending a missionary is managed in the [Missionary Online Recommendation System (MORS)](https://missionaryrecommendations.churchofjesuschrist.org). 

When an individual expresses their interest in serving a mission, the bishop initiates the process using MORS and the process starts from there. The missionary candidate completes the online MORS forms, and obtains a physical and dental exam according to the instructions there.

The bishop will receive the medical and dental evaluation forms from the physician and dentist. He should review the forms, *make sure they are complete*, and discuss any concerns with the missionary candidate. Then he passes the forms to the stake clerk for entry who transcribes the medical and dental forms into MORS.

**Bishops,** please review the following before passing the recommendation on to the stake level:

* Make sure that, in their photo, the candidate is wearing missionary attire as described in MORS.
* When reviewing the medical and dental forms, make sure they are complete. Commonly missed items are: the vision screening, Tuberculosis screening, and "... any medication ... that might impair their ability to drive?". If there is any missing information the form, you or the missionary candidate will need to contact the physician.
* If a psychological evaluation is indicated for any reason, please arrange that with **Church Family Services** and review the results before forwarding the recommendation to the stake level.
* If there are special concerns or considerations, please discuss those with the stake president.

Once the stake clerk transcries the medical and dental forms, he notifies the Stake Assistant Executive Secretary to make an appointment for the missionary candidate with the stake president.
